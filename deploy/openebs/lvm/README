## OpenEBS - LocalPV-LVM CSI Driver with ClickHouse
LocalPV-LVM CSI Driver became GA in August 2021 (with the release v0.8.0). It is now a very mature product and a core component of the OpenEBS storage platform.
Due to the major adoption of LocalPV-LVM (+50,000 users), this Data-Engine is now being unified and integrated into the core OpenEBS Storage platform; instead of being maintained as an external Data-Engine within our project.

## Setup

Find the disk which you want to use for the LocalPV-LVM. Note: For testing you can use the loopback device.

```
truncate -s 1024G /tmp/disk.img
sudo losetup -f /tmp/disk.img --show
```

> [!NOTE]
> - This is the old maual config process <BR>
> - LocalPV-LVM will num dynamically provision the VG fro you <BR>
> - The PV, VG and LV names will be dynamically provisioned by OpenEBS LocalPV-LVM as K8s unique entities (for safety, you cannot provide your own PV, VG or LV names)

Create the Volume group on all the nodes, which will be used by the LVM2 Driver for provisioning the volumes

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/loop0
sudo vgcreate vg-test /dev/loop0       ## here lvmvg is the volume group name to be created
```

Display the Volume Group

```
vgdisplay
```

## Installation

Install the latest release of OpenEBS LVM2 LocalPV-LVM driver by running the following command. Note: All nodes must be running the same version of LocalPV-LVM, LMV2, device-mapper & dm-snapshot.

Create a variable containing the K8s namesapce

```bash
OPENEBS_NAMESPACE=openebs
```

Install the OpenEBS component without the distributed component (MayaStor) and ZFS

```bash
helm repo add openebs https://openebs.github.io/openebs
helm repo update
helm install openebs --namespace ${OPENEBS_NAMESPACE} openebs/openebs --set engines.replicated.mayastor.enabled=false --set engines.local.zfs.enabled=false --create-namespace --version 4.1.1
```

List the OpenEBS chart and check that it's deployed

```bash
helm list -n ${OPENEBS_NAMESPACE}
NAME   	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                              	STATUS  	CHART        	APP VERSION
openebs	openebs  	1       	2024-06-01 12:28:49.358189 +0200 CEST	deployed	openebs-4.0.1	4.0.1
```

You can uninstall the OpenEBS componenent if there is any issues or for testing different version

```bash
helm uninstall openebs --namespace ${OPENEBS_NAMESPACE}
```

Create a new Storage Class
```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
allowVolumeExpansion: true
metadata:
  name: openebs-lvm-test
parameters:
  fsType: xfs
  storage: lvm
  vgpattern: vg-test
provisioner: local.csi.openebs.io
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```
